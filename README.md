## 3. List of API Endpoints

**General Statistics**
* GET average age of all patients returned as a string: ```/averageage```
* GET observation statistics(total/most common observations and observation components) of all patients returned as a JSON: ```/observationstats```



## 4. Web App Uses

The Web App can be used to get the list of patients, patient information(uuid, fullname, contact, gender, age, address, marital status, languages spoken, multiple birth, identifiers, extensions, etc.), as well as patient observations(uuid, observationtype, observation components, effective datetime, etc.)

Clicking on the Graphs button on the patient information page will open a new tab with a few graphs that are plotted using the patient's observation data. If some of the observation are missing from the patient, the graph will show an empty graph. The graphs that are included are related to Blood Pressure(Diastolic and Systolic), Heart Rate and Respiratory Rate, Height, Weight, BMI and BMI Percentile, as well as Pain Severity.

Routes
* ```/``` -- this is to get the list of patients
* ```/patient/<patient id>``` -- this is to get the patient and observation information
* ```/statistics/<patient id>``` -- this is to get the graphs of a patient
